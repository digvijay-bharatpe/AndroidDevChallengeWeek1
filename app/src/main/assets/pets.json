He is a very intelligent boy, leash trained, super friendly, and very affectionate with humans. He loves spending his time in the play area jumping, running, and playing fetch. Receiving cuddles and kisses is his favorite.",

We had to perform an amputation surgery on her and now she is recovering. She is sweetness itself, and her little tail wags endear her to everyone who meets her. She is also great with other dogs, and can make friends with almost anyone. So far she is also fantastic with cats! Basically, she is the greatest :D We are looking for people who will shower her with all the love that she deserves.",

I am quite curious about cats, so possibly might want to chase them. It is probably best to have a cat free home.\n\nI will need some basic training, as I am not yet house trained. I really haven't much been in a house. But, my intelligence should lend to quick learning.\n\nI am a very kind dog and I can be playful, so I hope you will enjoy teaching me some games.
